/**
// Rules:
// ---------------
//   1. If it's a hack, it goes in _shame.css.
//   2. Document all hacks fully:
//   3. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//   4. Why was this needed?
//   5. How does this fix it?
//   6. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//   7. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
//   8. Try and clean _shame.css up when you have some down time.
